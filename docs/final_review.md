# Final QA Review — Flight Booking System

**Reviewer:** Delivery review loop (7 experts + reconciliation)
**Date:** 2026-05-29
**Source of truth:** `docs/final_requierments.md` (LOCKED)
**Verdict:** ✅ READY TO DELIVER — `go test ./...` passes; S-1..S-5 covered; Critical/High findings resolved

---

## Executive Summary

The 2026-05-28 audit reported three failing integration tests and a missing 3×3 payment model. **Both are resolved.** The codebase implements Temporal workflow updates for booking, 15-minute holds with refresh, 3 codes × 3 attempts payment exhaustion, SSE with polling fallback, and multi-flight isolation. This cycle stabilized flaky workflow unit tests and aligned seat-map UI to PATCH holds on click.

## Test Execution Results

### Run: `go test ./... -count=1 -timeout 120s` (2026-05-29)

| Package | Result |
|---------|--------|
| `neon/internal/api` | ✅ PASS |
| `neon/internal/api/handler` | ✅ PASS |
| `neon/internal/infrastructure/memory` | ✅ PASS |
| `neon/internal/workflow/booking` | ✅ PASS |

## Scenario Test Results

| Scenario | ID | Description | Result |
|----------|----|-------------|--------|
| S-1 | Happy path | Select → pay success → CONFIRMED | ✅ `TestI_C1`, `TestU_C1` |
| S-2 | Timer refresh | Hold → add seat → timer resets to 15m | ✅ `TestI_B1`, `TestU_B2` |
| S-3 | Method exhaustion | Fail 3 codes × 3 attempts | ✅ `TestI_D1` |
| S-4 | Late payment | Payment racing against expiry | ✅ `TestI_D2`, `TestU_D4` |
| S-5 | Multi-flight isolation | 1A on Flight A ≠ 1A on Flight B | ✅ `TestI_B2`, `TestU_B7` |

## Resolved Since 2026-05-28 Audit

| # | Was | Now |
|---|-----|-----|
| FR-1 | 3 integration tests failing on deleted `new-method` route | Route restored; `TestI_D10` passes |
| FR-2 | 3-total-failure payment model | 3×3 model with `MethodsUsed`, `CurrentCodeFailures` |
| FR-4 | UI counters always 0/0 | API exposes `methods_used` / `methods_remaining` |

---

## Remaining Medium Findings (non-blocking)

| ID | Area | Issue |
|----|------|-------|
| ARCH-2 | Docs | `final_plan.md` still uses “signal” terminology; code uses workflow updates |
| ARCH-3 | Requirements | `PAYMENT_FAILED` terminal state not named in locked requirements §4 |
| TEMP-2 | API contract | Implicit code switch after failures vs explicit `new-method` in plan |
| QA-1 | Test matrix | U-D1–U-D3 workflow unit rows not implemented (integration covers S-3) |
| UI-2 | E2E | Playwright E-E3 exercises one code only, not full 3×3 UI journey |
| DATA-1 | Repository | `Release` not idempotent on retry |

---

## Positive Assessment

- **Temporal integration:** Workflow updates, activities, timer race (S-4), and hold reconciliation are sound.
- **Seat consistency:** Per-flight mutex prevents double-booking in memory store.
- **Test coverage:** Integration suite exercises end-to-end flows; injectable RNG enables deterministic payment tests.
- **Layering:** Domain, workflow, infrastructure, and API boundaries are clean.

## Verdict

| Dimension | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Core booking flow | ✅ |
| Timer lifecycle | ✅ |
| Multi-method payment (3×3) | ✅ |
| Race condition handling (S-4) | ✅ |
| Multi-flight isolation (S-5) | ✅ |
| Real-time updates (SSE + fallback) | ✅ |
| Test suite | ✅ |
| Documentation | ✅ (minor Medium drift in plan terminology) |

**The project is ready to deliver.** Medium findings above are recommended follow-ups, not submission blockers.
